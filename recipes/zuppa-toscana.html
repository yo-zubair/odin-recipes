    <h2>Easy Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana Soup</h2>
    <p>This Easy Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana Soup is a super quick and simple copycat recipe with rich, creamy flavor you can’t resist! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage (I prefer hot, but mild or sweet also work)</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1 pound red potatoes, halved and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch kale, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly-grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>optional: crushed red pepper flakes, for extra heat</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, crumbling the sausage with a spoon as it cooks. Transfer the sausage to a separate plate using a slotted spoon, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onion to the remaining sausage grease in the pan, and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and sauté for 1-2 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock and potatoes, and stir to combine. Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer. Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in the kale, cooked sausage, cream, and Parmesan until combined. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and optional red pepper flakes as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm, garnished with extra Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
